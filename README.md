# Computer Vision Projects

A repository of a few of my computer vision projects.

If you face any problems viewing my 'Handwritten Digit Recognition using a Shallow Neural Net' Jupyter Notebook on github, you can view it on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chaitanyaspatil/Computer-Vision-Projects/blob/master/Handwritten%20Digit%20Recognition%20using%20a%20Shallow%20Neural%20Net.ipynb.
